# LCD Discrete Files
- Contains the same files as the video.
- Each function is in a seperate file for easy manipulation.




# LCD Single File
- Only contains one ".c" file.
- The procedure for loading is the same as the one in the video.
- All of the functions are in the same file.
- Better if you don't plan on checking or manipulating the functions.



# LICENSE
- Don't get scared by the "LICENCE" file or license comments written in the
code files. It's just a basic MIT license. It only states that, you have
the right to do literally anything you want with these codes (this includes
commercial use and modification) as long as you credit the original author 
(only if you publish it).
